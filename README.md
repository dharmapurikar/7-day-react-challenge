* Using Material-UI's grid system for layout 
* Displaying data with Material-UI cards or tables 

## Key Concepts

* Setting up Material-UI with a React project
* Using pre-built Material-UI components 
* Theming and customizing Material-UI components

## Additional Notes

* Refer to the Material-UI documentation for component usage and examples: https://mui.com/

By the end of the week, you will have built seven different applications, each focusing on different aspects of React. This will give you a solid understanding of how to build applications using React.js.
