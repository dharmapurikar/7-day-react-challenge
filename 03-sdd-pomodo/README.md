# Pomodoro Timer

This project is a Pomodoro Timer built with ReactJS and NodeJS.

## Concepts Used
- React Router
- Timers
- Nested Components
- User Preferences

## Description

The Pomodoro Timer application has distinct routes for different sessions - work, short break, and long break. Each route has a timer that counts down the time for that particular session. The timer can start, pause, and reset.

The application is modular and uses nested components for better structure and reusability.

Users can customize the length of each session. There is a settings page where users can set their preferred durations for work, short break, and long break sessions.

## Optional Features

- Notifications: The application can notify the user when a session ends. This can be a sound alert or a browser notification.
- Persistence: User preferences are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist across sessions.
